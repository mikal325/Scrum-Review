# Scrum-Review
User needs are interperted as requests.  As a wish list of things that they wished the program would/could do.  As I implement the user stories I am completing the things that they want, which is on the list of things to accomplish
While developing programs I plan on incorporating open communication, and problem solving skills to think outside the box to solve complicated problems.
A good team member in software development would openly communicate concerns and advice to team members in order to increase productivity.  While working together to accomplish user stories for the final product.
